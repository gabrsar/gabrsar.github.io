    <p> I’m Gabriel H. M. Saraiva, a software developer, that want to become a f**king good software engineer in near future. </p>
    <p> I was born in Araraquara city at São Paulo in Brazil, but now I'm living in São Paulo city,  working in <a href="http://www.99taxis.com">99Taxis</a> with software development. </p>
    <img class="left-photo img-rounded" src="{{ site.url }}/img/prettyGuy.png" alt="Pretty Guy (me)">
    <p> Before moves to São Paulo city to work, I was in São José do Rio Preto city, where I graduated in Computer Science at “Universidade Estadual Paulista” (<a href="http://www.unesp.br/international/">Unesp</a>).</p>
    <p> My favorite hobbies are talk about space, planets, rockets, observe the night sky, write funny code just to see if it will compile, make code run as fast as possible (sometimes) and as gracefully as possible (when I need to change it after some time). Since from my twelve years I always loved hack Linuxes and blow up my entire system and reinstall all from scratch. And no, I don’t have fear of get a KERNEL PANIC, actually I laugh a lot when I see one <s>after crying for 5 minutes like a child</s>. </p>
    <p>And I'm lefty if you want know.</p>
